	    "King of My Heart"

<pre>
Let the King of my heart
Be the mountain where I run
The fountain I drink from
Oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the shadow where I hide
The ransom for my life
Oh, He is my song

'Cause You are good, You're good, mm-mm
You are good, You're good, mm-mm

Let the King of my heart
Be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves
Oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my veins
The echo of my days
Oh, He is my song

'Cause You are good, You're good, oh-oh
You are good, You're good, oh-oh
You are good, You're good, oh-oh
You are good, You're good, oh-oh

You're never gonna let, You're never gonna let me down
You're never gonna let, You're never gonna let me down
You're never gonna let, You're never gonna let me down
You're never gonna let, You're never gonna let me down
You're never gonna let, You're never gonna let me down
You're never gonna let, You're never gonna let me down

'Cause You are good, You're good, mm-mm
You are good, You're good, mm-mm
You are good, You're good, mm-mm
You are good, You're good, mm-mm

	    "I Am Not Alone"
	</strong>
<pre>
When I walk through deep waters
I know that You will be with me
When I'm standing in the fire
I will not be overcome
Through the valley of the shadow
I will not fear

I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me
I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me

In the midst of deep sorrow
I see Your light is breaking through
The dark of night will not overtake me
I am pressing into You
Lord, You fight my every battle
And I will not fear

I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me
I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me

You amaze me
Redeem me
You call me as Your own
You amaze me
Redeem me
You call me as Your own
You amaze me
Redeem me
You call me as Your own
You amaze me
Redeem me
You call me as Your own

You're my strength
You're my defender
You're my refuge in the storm
Through these trials
You've always been faithful
You bring healing to my soul

I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me
I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me
I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me
I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me
I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me
I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me
