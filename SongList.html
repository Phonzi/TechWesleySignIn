Bless the Lord, Oh my soul
Oh my soul, worship his holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
I'll worship your holy name

The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
It's time to sing your song again
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

Bless the Lord, Oh my soul
Oh my soul, worship his holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

You're rich in love and You're slow to anger
Your name is great and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

Bless the Lord, Oh my soul
Oh my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

Bless the Lord, oh my soul
Oh my soul, Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, oh my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore
Forevermore

Bless the Lord, Oh my soul
Oh my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

Bless the Lord, oh my soul
Oh my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, oh my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

Oh my soul bless the Lord,

Bless the Lord, oh my soul
Oh my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, oh my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

I'll worship
I'll worship Your holy name

	    "Lord I Need You"
	</strong>
<pre>
Lord, I come, I confess
Bowing here I find my rest
Without You I fall apart
You're the One that guides my heart

Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

Where sin runs deep Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
And where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness is Christ in me

Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

To teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
When I cannot stand I'll fall on You
Jesus, You're my hope and stay

Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

You're my one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You
