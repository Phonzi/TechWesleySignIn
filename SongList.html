		"We are called"
	    </strong>
<pre>
Come! live in the light!
Shine with the joy and the love of the Lord!
We are called to be light for the kingdom,
to live in the freedom of the city of God!

We are called to act with justice.
We are called to love tenderly.
We are called to serve one another, to walk humbly with God.

Come! Open your heart!
Show your mercy to all those in fear!
We are called to be hope for the hopeless,
so all hatred and blindness will be no more!

We are called to act with justice.
We are called to love tenderly.
We are called to serve one another, to walk humbly with God.

Sing! Sing a new song!
Sing of that great day when all will be one!
God will reign and we'll walk with each other as sisters
and brothers united in love!

We are called to act with justice.
We are called to love tenderly.
We are called to serve one another, to walk humbly with God.

We are called to act with justice.
We are called to love tenderly.
We are called to serve one another, to walk humbly with God.

	    "Blessed Assurance"
	</strong>
<pre>
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
O what a foretaste of glory divine
Heir of salvation, purchase of God
I'm born of his Spirit and washed in his blood

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

Perfect submission, perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight
Angels descending bring from above
Echoes of mercy and whispers of love

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

Perfect submission, all is at rest
I in my Savior am happy and blessed
You know I'm watching and waiting, I'm looking above
Filled with His goodness and I'm lost in his love

This is my, I know that this is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

My life is Yours
My hope is in You only
And my heart You hold
'Cause You made this sinner holy
Holy holy

'Cause Your glory is so beautiful
I fall onto my knees in awe
And the heartbeat of my life
Is to worship in Your light
'Cause Your glory is so beautiful
'Cause Your glory is so beautiful

And my life is Yours
And my hope is in You only
And my heart You hold
'Cause You made this sinner holy
Holy holy

'Cause Your glory is so beautiful
I fall onto my knees in awe
And the heartbeat of my life
Is to worship in Your light
'Cause Your glory is so beautiful
'Cause Your glory is so beautiful

Glory glory
Hallelujah
Jesus You are good
[x3]

We sing
Glory glory
Hallelujah
Jesus You are good

'Cause Your glory is so beautiful
I fall onto my knees in awe
And the heartbeat of my life
Is to worship in Your light
'Cause Your glory is so beautiful
Your glory is so beautiful
