<pre>
Lord of all creation
Of water earth and sky
The heavens are Your Tabernacle
Glory to the Lord on high

God of wonders beyond our galaxy
You are Holy, Holy
The universe declares Your Majesty
And You are Holy Holy

Early in the morning
I will celebrate the light
When I stumble in the darkness
I will call Your Name by night

Lord of heaven and earth

Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth

Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth
Holy, Holy, Holy God

	    "Blessed Assurance"
	</strong>
<pre>
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
O what a foretaste of glory divine
Heir of salvation, purchase of God
I'm born of his Spirit and washed in his blood

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

Perfect submission, perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight
Angels descending bring from above
Echoes of mercy and whispers of love

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

Perfect submission, all is at rest
I in my Savior am happy and blessed
You know I'm watching and waiting, I'm looking above
Filled with His goodness and I'm lost in his love

This is my, I know that this is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

	    "From Whom All Blessings Flow"
	</strong>
<pre>

What gift of love could I offer to a King
What weight or worth could be held within my offering
When He alone is worthy

A glory song is inscribed upon my heart
This treasure held in an alabaster jar I break
To bring Him all the glory

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below

What sacrifice could be equal to His own
The cross of Christ has declared that there is nought I owe
Yet I know I owe Him all

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise God from whom all blessings flow

Our Father God the infinite
The matchless King magnificent

The living Christ
The servant Son
The prophesied
The saving One

The Holy Ghost gift from above
The faithful Friend
The seal of love

This life, this heart
This song to Him
My all in all
My everything

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost

Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost
