	    "How Great Is Our God"
	</strong>
<pre>
The splendor of a King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great, how great is our God

Age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end

The Godhead Three in One
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great, how great is our God

Name above all names
Worthy of our praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God

Name above all names
You are worthy of our praise
And my heart will sing
How great is our God

How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great, how great is our God

How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great, how great is our God

How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great, how great is our God
