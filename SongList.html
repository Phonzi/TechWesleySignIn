		"Lord, I Lift Your Name on High"
	    </strong>
<pre>
Lord, I lift Your name on high
Lord, I love to sing Your praises
I'm so glad You're in my life
I'm so glad You came to save us

You came from Heaven to earth to show the way
From the earth to the cross my debt to pay
From the cross to the grave
From the grave to the sky
Lord, I lift Your name on high

Lord, I lift Your name on high
Lord, I love to sing Your praises
I'm so glad You're in my life
I'm so glad You came to save us

You came from Heaven to earth to show the way
From the earth to the cross my debt to pay
From the cross to the grave
From the grave to the sky
Lord, I lift Your name on high

You came from Heaven to earth to show the way
From the earth to the cross my debt to pay
From the cross to the grave
From the grave to the sky
Lord, I lift Your name on high

Lord, I lift Your name on high

	    "Here I am to Worship"
	</strong>
<pre>
Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness,
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You,
Hope of a life spent with You.

So here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

King of all days, oh, so highly exalted,
Glorious in heaven above,
Humbly You came
To the earth You created,
All for love's sake became poor.

So here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

Here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

And I'll never know
How much  it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross.

So here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

Here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

Here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

Here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

	    "Come Thou Fount"
	</strong>
<pre>

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of God's unchanging love

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I've come
And I hope by thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed his precious blood

Oh to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy grace now like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, oh, take it seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, oh take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of God's unchanging love
