 Come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Christ, our Redeemer—

<strong> Who was anointed by the spirit of God to bring good news to the poor.</strong>

 Come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Christ, our Redeemer—

<strong> Who was crucified by the keepers of order for heeding the summons of God.</strong>

 Come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Christ, our Redeemer—

<strong> Who baptizes us with the Holy Spirit for bringing the reign of God to earth.</strong>

<strong> Come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Christ, our Redeemer!</strong>
